### TV class

in this class we can determinate that to keep tack of its state, a TV class would have to maintain the following data:

- Power state (on or off)
- Mute state (is it muted?)
- List of channels available
- Current channel setting
- Current volume setting
- Range of volume levels available

And the actions that the TV must provide include:

- Turn the power on and off
- Raise and lower the volume
- Change the channel up and down
- Mute and unmute the sound
- Get information about the current settings
- Go to a specified channel
